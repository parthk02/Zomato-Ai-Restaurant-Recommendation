Phase 4 – Recommendation using an LLM (Groq-backed later).

This phase is responsible for:
- Turning normalized user input and candidate restaurants into a prompt.
- Calling an LLM client (Groq in later steps) to get recommendations.
- Parsing the LLM response into structured recommendation objects.

Note: The concrete Groq API client is intentionally left as a stub so
that we can develop and test Phase 4 without needing live API access.
